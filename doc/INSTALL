The installation of the extension is quick and painless. The only requirement is that eZ Find is activated and working properly.

1) Extract the archive to the extension folder of your eZ Publish install

2) Regenerate the autoload array

3) Clear the caches

4) Add Netgen Indexer datatype to your classes and configure the extension (for
   detailed instructions see doc/CONFIG)

5) Add the "Netgen Indexer" event to workflow triggers

6) Code some fun stuff!
